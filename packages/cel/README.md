# Common Expression Library

Note: This library intends to be a one to one port of [`cel-go`](https://github.com/google/cel-go). But, there may be differences caused by the limitations TypeScript/JavaScript compared to other CEL implementations. For instance, floats may lose precision after `2^53-1` and there is no functional difference between `int` and `uint` values as those are limitations of JavaScript.

The Common Expression Language (CEL) is a non-Turing complete language designed
for simplicity, speed, safety, and portability. CEL's C-like [syntax][1] looks
nearly identical to equivalent expressions in C++, Go, Java, and TypeScript.

```java
// Check whether a resource name starts with a group name.
resource.name.startsWith("/groups/" + auth.claims.group)
```

```go
// Determine whether the request is in the permitted time window.
request.time - resource.age < duration("24h")
```

```typescript
// Check whether all resource names in a list match a given filter.
auth.claims.email_verified && resources.all(r, r.startsWith(auth.claims.email))
```

A CEL "program" is a single expression. The examples have been tagged as
`java`, `go`, and `typescript` within the markdown to showcase the commonality
of the syntax.
